## 🌾 FarmHire – Bridging the Gap for Migrant Farmers
### 🚀 Project built during the Rajasthan IT Day Hackathon (Powered by PW Skills)



## 📝 Project Description

FarmHire is a web-based platform designed to support migrant farmers who are away from their farms and lack the time, skills, or resources to manage them. The platform enables farmers to rent agricultural help, connect with local service providers, and access essential farming services remotely.

Our mission: Bridge the gap between landowners and agriculture professionals using tech-driven, easy-to-use solutions.


## 💡 Problem Statement

“Agriculture is still a challenge” — Migrant farmers often face difficulties in managing their farmland due to distance and lack of available help. Our project aims to resolve this by offering a digital marketplace where services related to farming can be easily found and rented.
